rnote is a simple package that allows you to make notes and recall them from any project by saving them to the package directory.

Make a note with:
```{r}
rnote::jotdown(note = "this is a note", topics = c("test_topic1", "test_topic2"))
```

Recall notes to console with:
```{r}
rnote::checknotes(topic = "test_topic1", current_project = FALSE, n = 10)
```
